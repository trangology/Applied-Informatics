The default board game is designed for human plays with computer. Computer will make the first move with the white side.

You will be asked to enter a number which is the number of locations of your move (including your current location). For example, you want to move the pieces which is currently at row 3 and column 2 to row 4 and column 2, you need to enter 2 at first.
